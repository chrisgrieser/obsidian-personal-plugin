Personal Obsidian plugin, containing features customized to my workflow. Do not
expect this plugin to get published. The only reason this is public is so that I
can reference code snippets from it.

## Features
- Auto-Spellcheck: When in [longform](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform)
  note or in note has cssclass `writing`, toggles spellcheck **on**, otherwise **off**.
- Status bar item indicating is spellcheck is active.
- Lazy-loads a few "writing-only" plugins only when entering a writing or
  longform note (Language Tools, Commentary, Text Generator, Natural Language
  Syntax Highlighting).
- When in [longform](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform)
  note, open the longform sidebar pane. Otherwise, open the
  outgoing-links-sidebar. Also sets specific sizes for the panes.
