Personal Obsidian plugin, containing features customized to my workflow. Do not
expect documentation for this plugin, or this plugin to be published.

The only reason this is public is so that I can reference code snippets from it.

## Features
- Auto-Spellcheck: When in [longform](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform)
  note or in note has cssclass `writing`, toggles spellcheck **on**, otherwise **off**.
- Status bar item indicating is spellcheck is active.
- Lazy-loads a few "writing-only" plugins only when entering a writing or
  longform note (Language Tools, Longform, Dynamic Highlights, etc.).
